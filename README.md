# Python-studying

Project Jarvis
- I was trying create a script to help me optimalize processes with routine activities. Script should respond to voice commands. I only tested that on my own computer, so a few things will not be working.

Old version worked in english. The newest work only in polish.

Commands:
  - komputer - main command. Without that script will not respond
    -"10" or "ten" - shutdown system
    -"1" or "one" - open notepad
    -"pisz" - open MS Word
    -"film" - open OBS ( DON'T WORK, problem with OBS)
    -"nauka" - open MS Teams
    -"sen" - hibernate system
